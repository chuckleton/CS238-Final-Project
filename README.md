# CS238-Final-Project

A framework for rapid development and iteration of reinforcement learning models for optimization of spacecraft operations based on the System Tool Kit. This framework allows development of reinforcement learning models for a wide variety of spacecraft operations from launch to orbit to deep space without the creation of underlying physical models.
